## About The Project

This project simulates a full-stack application using only front-end technologies. It helps users navigate their early career by connecting them with courses and jobs aligned with current tech trends. All user data, course registrations, and job applications are saved locally in the browser's `localStorage`, creating a persistent experience without a backend server.
